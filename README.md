# CS-350-Thermostat

This project uses Code Composer Studio to connect to a TI CC3220S LaunchPad to prototype a thermostat. I believe I did task scheduling with multiple periods well, as the project itself functions as intended and is easily readable. I do think I could improve on the naming of things in the program, particularly in naming the states of each switch. I feel as though some legibility is lost in how I named the switches in the state machine for pressing the buttons. Overall I feel like I gained a better understanding of utilizing drivers and timer flags. Throughout this project and the previous labs I had to go through each of the drivers header file to really understanded how everything worked. This was something that I have not had to do previously and I believe the experience will benefit me more in future projects and course work.
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by trying to use consistent syntax and spacing throughout to keep it legible. I also added clear comments throughout the code to explain the function and thought process
